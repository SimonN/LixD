Contributors to Lix
===================

I (Simon Naarmann) wrote nearly all of the code and drew the character sprites,
but my thanks go to all community memebrs that shaped Lix over the years:

geoo
    * Tilesets in images/geoo.
    * Many levels contributed to levels/lemforum/, the flagship levelpack.
    * Initiating and maintaining levels/lemforum/ for several years.
    * Lots of technical feedback on game mechanics over many years.
    * Code to load Lemmings 2 tilesets in C++ Lix in 2009.
        D Lix can no longer load Lemmings 1/2 tilesets. I cannot ship these
        tilesets with Lix anyway because of their third-party copyrights.

Raymanni:
    *  Toys, lab, gore, and holiday tilesets in images/raymanni.

Matt C.
    * Tilesets in images/matt/.
        These tilesets helped tremendously towards releasing Lix as
        free-and-open-source in 2011.

Rubix
    * levels/rubix, an entire levelpack.
    * Many multiplayer maps, both for D Lix and for early C++ Lix in 2009.
    * Lix introduction videos on Youtube.
    * The menu music, released as public domain, and two custom tracks
        in music/rubix/, released as CC4-BY (see doc/copying.txt).

Forestidia
    * Many issue reports and super-quick feedback on bugfixes.
    * Playing through most included levels, reporting backroutes.
    * Renovating ClamLix, an entire levelpack by Clam, for D Lix in 2017.
    * Collecting and renovating old standalone Lix levels for D Lix:

Amanda B. (NaOH)
    * Tilesets in images/naoh
    * Pushing for simpler game mechanics, e.g., no variable spawn interval
        in singleplayer. I had that idea before but lacked courage in 2015.

Proxima
    * Contributing many levels to levels/lemforum, the flagship pack.
    * Maintaining levels/lemforum/ since 2016.
    * The tiles in images/proxima/: Abstract square tiles and spheres.

Nepster
    * NepsterLix, an entire levelpack.

mobius
    * Together with minim, 5 tracks in music/minim-mobius, released as
        public domain.
    * Several levels in levels/lemforum.
    * Project Capybara, a levelpack for Lix that I did not include because
        it felt too close to the copyrighted Lemmings 1 levels.

Lucki
    * Maintaining the Arch Linux Lix package in the AUR:
        https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lix/

Gürkan S. (tarzeau)
    * Hosting the Lix website and game server from 2010 to 2016.

Mindless
    * Running the IRC bot in irc.quakenet.org #lix to announce forum topics.
    * Hosting my game server in 2009 and 2010.

Clam
    * ClamLix, an entire levelpack. This pack has no maintainer these days,
        Forestidia and mobius renovated it for D Lix in 2017.

Insane Steve
    * Many levels in levels/lemforum/.
    * Early multiplayer maps and playtesting in 2009.

minim
    * Together with mobius, 5 tracks in music/minim-mobius, released as
        public domain.

CyberShadow
    * Contributing code to early D Lix to for better bitmap buttons
        on large resolutions.

All multiplayer level designers
    * Many playtesting sessions.
    * Building over 600 maps in total.
