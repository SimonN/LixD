Version history of the Lix D/Allegro 5 port
===========================================

0.6.15
------

2016-09-13

Started networking backend, lobby, and console. You can log onto the central
server at lixgame.com and chat.

Fix #145: The editor calced twice after its boxes lost focus. You could cancel
a box with a hotkey, and the editor interpreted the hotkey itself once more.

Fix #151: When there is no savestate, the state-load button is hidden.

Fast movement frees mouse: This option is off by default.

0.6.14
------

2016-09-01

Command-line switches to jump into play:
    lix level.txt                plays the level.
    lix replay.txt               plays the replay against its included level.
    lix --pointed-to replay.txt  plays the replay against its pointed-to level.
    lix level.txt replay.txt     plays the replay against the given level.

Minor bugs left behind here: Depending on from where the levels are run,
they do or don't generate checkmarks. Auto-replays should always be saved,
even if, when not run from the root directory, the replays are called unknown.

Command-line switch to export images. The following command-line exports as
images the two given levels, and all levels recursively found in mydir:
    lix --image level1.txt level2.txt mydir

Fix #149: Singleplayer always displays a dialog at end of play again,
so you can control the entire application with the mouse alone. You can
framestep back from this dialog.

0.6.13
------

2016-08-27

Lemforum levels got updates from August 2016. I deleted the tutorial levels:
The lemforum pack is our flagship pack and starts with very easy levels.
Other packs need not provide tutorial levels.

Fix #142: There is a virtual file system. It recognizes ./ and ../ now.
Other directories, in particular installations in Linux File System Hierarchy
trees, aren't supported yet, but the necessary changes have become easy.

Fix #148: When you fail a singleplayer level, the game halts and allows you
to go back in time. It doesn't spawn a dialog box anymore.

Fix #144: In the editor, when you mirrored a piece with transparent pixels at
its sides, the piece moved. Entire selections diverged on repeated mirroring.

Fix #84 and #90: The options menu explains its options, except on the editor
tab. The box near the menu's bottom provides two lines of explanation.

0.6.12
------

2016-08-07

Fix #134: Select multiple tiles in the editor and press rotate.
The tiles rotate correctly with respect to each other. Rotating 4 times
puts them back exactly where they started, they don't wander. This works
even if oddly-sized tiles or unrotatable gadgets are in the selection.

Fix #139: The browsers for hatches, goals, decoration, and hazards display
all tiles in the images/ tree in one listing.

Fix #140: The terrain browser starts browsing from the directory of the
tile you have selected at the moment. If you haven't selected anything,
they start from the directory from which you've most recently added a tile.

Fix #143: The file selector scrolls to the final row, even if it's less
than half-filled. Before, the scrollbar looked like there were more files,
but didn't make the tiler display these extra files.

Swapped author and level title in the editor's constant-setting window.

0.6.11
------

2016-08-06

lemforum pack: Many updates by Proxima and geoo. Fewer lix in Hopeless.
geoo has rebuilt Spin Geometry with completely new terrain, and renamed it
to All Aboard the Pain Train. Off the Rails is now Railroad Plot, and
Derailed Level got a derailing locomotive as decoration.

Fix #117: Name-asking menu for new players exits with plain Esc. I don't
display anything for this.

Fix #131 and #111: Simpler starting zoom. Depending on your game
resolution, either all levels start as 1x or all levels start as 2x. Test
and see if you like the zoom for your resolution.

Fix #122: When you continue from a saved replay, then win, or save
manually, the new replay goes into the correct directory and points to the
correct level file.

Fix #133: The singleplayer menu shows the player's best score: Lix saved
and skills used.

Fix #138: Editor hotkeys work even while you're dragging. The buttons on
screen are disabled for the mouse during drag.

Fix #127: I hide dot-files, like .git, in level directories.

0.6.10
------

2016-07-31

In the lemforum pack, 237 of all 240 levels are guaranteed to be solvable.
The remaining possibly-unsovable levels are Trading and Cooperating,
The Mile High Club, and Striking News at Ten.

Fix #116: Editor shows the top-left point of a multiple selection, the minimal
coordinate each in both the x- and y-direction.

Fix #130: After state-loading a different timeline, framestepping moved back
to the undesired timeline. Now, I discard old savestates until the merge base
of the two timelines, and recompute from there on savestate.

Fix #91: Editor buttons are disabled when dragging.

0.6.9
-----

2016-07-27

Miners throw their pickaxe into the air when they hit steel.

Option: Do fast mouse movements untrap the mouse from windowed Lix?

lemforum pack updated by Proxima, again first 5 ranks solvable.

0.6.8
-----

2016-07-22

Decoration updated on Any Way You Want, The Road Goes Ever On, Just Stop
the Bleeding.

Fix #125: disksave.ogg was too loud, changed from 0 dBFS to -4.5 dBFS.

0.6.7
-----

2016-07-22

The lemforum pack's first 5 ranks are guaranteed to be solvable. geoo has
given maintenance of the lemforum pack to Proxima. Proxima has spent days
on careful level adaption to D Lix and difficulty reordering.
Out: Get Down From There, Minimalism Part 3.
In: Don't Look Back (jagged floor instead of a time-limit gadget),
    Canadian Glade (inspired by Get Down From There, uses the forest tileset).

Fix #111: Initial zoom on torus maps was too zoomed in.

Fix #112: Hotkey labels ran over nearby buttons.

Fix #118: When Lix wasn't the foreground window, it trapped the mouse
nonetheless when the cursor passed over the inactive window. Now, you must
click into the window to trap the mouse. This fix made visible another bug:
In the inactive Lix, the ingame cursor moves offset from the hardware cursor.

Worked on #124: I don't add 0x0 as a fullscreen mode anymore.

0.6.6
-----

2016-07-17

The lemforum community pack has Proxima's suggestions up to 2016-07-17.
Several levels have moved between ranks. Some have been replaced entirely:
Out: Minimalism (Part 1), Fear of Heights, That Pesky Gap, Don't Look Back,
    Too Far to Walk
In: A Necklace of Raindrops, The Road Not Taken, All Around the World,
    Diggin' the Air, A Soulful Bounding Leap

--coverage switch to use along with --verify, to compute level directory
coverage. From all levels that reside in level directories from where you
have tested at least one pointed-to level of a replay with --verify,
--coverage lists those levels that didn't enjoy even a single solution.
Please read levmaint.txt for detailed instructions. Example command line:

    lix --verify=replays/path/to/dir --coverage

Fix #113: Shorter key names with unicode symbols. In particular, keys on
the numeric pad have a nice symbol that looks like the keypad.

Fix #120: Topology updates correct equation, not only the horizontal equation

Some assertions to debug issue #121 on MacOS.

0.6.5
-----

2016-07-03

Fix #103: When you re-enter the window, the ingame mouse starts moving from
where the hardware mouse entered the window.

Fix #108: Adventure Playground displays again in the preview and is playable.

The replay browser has two buttons to start replays: One replays against the
included level, one replays against the pointed-to level.

Updated the lemforum community pack to geoo89/lixlfpack commit 2a91852.
This reorders some levels. Two levels have been replaced entirely:
Out: Three Days of the Condor, Absolute Zero
In: Lixes in Motion, Eye of the Needle

Afterwards, the lemforum pack got fewer initial lix in the lower three ratings
Simple, Quirky, Cunning. Proxima has played all these levels, tested for
solvability under a fixed spawn interval, and recommended lower initial lix
counts that keep the level idea fully intact. We have removed about 2,000 lix.

0.6.4
-----

2016-06-27

Editor increases the level's $BUILT when saving a changed level.

Fix #106: With mixed dirs and files, picker couldn't scroll to the last file.
Fix #107: Prefer queuing builders to spamming, then you couldn't queue at all.

New user option to unpause on skill assignments.

Tutorial levels are solvable again, and you can't die in them as easily.

0.6.3
-----

2016-06-22

Fix #97: The game advances physics on assignment and unpauses on nuking.

The browsers' breadcrumbs are wider and less tall. I don't display the current
directory in the browser's title bar anymore. The picker shows 20 files
instead of 19, this fixes #96.

The preview draws a dark border around the level instead of the menu color.
Under the preview, I write the level name.

0.6.2
-----

2016-06-20

Multiple hotkeys can be bound to the same function. By default, the editor
moves tiles both with the arrow keys and with ESDF. Pause is bound to [Space]
and to the middle mouse button.

Editor grouping, ungrouping, saving, and save-as can be hotkeyed.

0.6.1
-----

2016-06-18

Editor displays the trigger area of all gadgets.

0.6.0
-----

2016-06-15

Physics: Imploder mask is symmetric. It's wider by 1 lo-res pixel to the right.

You can drag the scrollbar thumb with the left mouse button.

0.5.0
-----

2016-06-14

Physics: Groups with steel have correct distribution of steel, earth, air.

I highlight on the map the lix under the mouse cursor who would get assigned.

The Editor allows to ungroup tiles.

I show hatch spawn direction, describe hovered tiles, and use a more
peaceful color flow for hovers and selections. Save-as forbids special chars.

The game shows the constant spawn interval in the panel. I don't know
whether I want to keep this and make an icon for it, or whether people
don't need it later.

0.4.4
-----

2016-06-06

Bugfixes for these github issues:
#67: Z-ordering several tiles
#85: Hover sorting guarantees group's z-order
#81: Crash on nonexistant base directory of a browser
Button hotkeys are drawn on top of buttons, not behind main text.

I now try to paint the screen black immediately on display creation.
I don't want a white flash before showing the main menu. I have to test at
Icho's Windows machine whether this prevents the white flash.

0.4.3
-----

2016-06-02

Loading levels auto-converts from no-overwrite to tile groups.

Even in a release build, an on-the-fly conversion takes 5.5 seconds for
A Day In Lixtown and 1.2 seconds for Heed the Traffic Light. Lixtown has 2000
pieces and does fancy tricks with no-overwrite. I have to decide whether
the performance is acceptable, whether to improve the algorithm, or whether
to save converted levels to file.

Merged a tree tile by Amanda to prevent getting stuck in its leaves.

Editor remembers the recently-loaded or recently-saved file, similar to how
the game remembers the recently-played level. The singleplayer browser
shows the most recent file.

Don't show elapsed time in singleplayer. It looks like a time limit.
Does anyone want the elapsed time shown nonetheless?

0.4.2
-----

2016-06-01

Level reads and writes tile groups.

The game renders groups with correct air parts inside.
I haven't tested steel, I expect bugs when grouping steel.

There is no conversion yet from no-overwrite to groups.

0.4.1
-----

2016-05-25

Game and editor draw a thin line at the torus seam. This is optional.

The automatic screen start snaps to the level boundary if it's close to it
and the level has no wrapping in that direction.

Started tile grouping using Nepster's algorithm. Thanks for the straightforward
idea in O(n^2), with tips on how to optimize to O(n log n) if wanted!

0.4.0
-----

2016-05-23

Physics change: Climbers couldn't ascend into 1-pixel high gaps with an
overhanging ceiling.

Fix #73: Tile selection boxes were offset. Reason: A5 rotates tiles clockwise.
Many parts of the D Lix source assumed a counter-clockwise rotation.

0.3.7
-----

2016-05-21

The editor's save-as dialog is implemented. It doesn't preview the old level,
but asks before overwriting.

0.3.6
-----

2016-05-18

Editor: new file, quit, and save to existing file are implemented. The editor
asks whether you would like to save when you would lose data on new or quit.

Fixed an editor crash on querying terrain on tiles with negative coordinates.

The editor saves to ./levels/editor-emergency-save.txt when you click save-as,
because save-as is not implemented yet. The editor saves to that file too
on assertion fails, as a safeguard.

0.3.5
-----

2016-05-15

geoo has designed awesome glyphs, representing mouse wheel and buttons.
The infinity symbol is now a big lemniscate. I've included the new glyphs
in the default font. Thank you, geoo!

Editor has a window to set the main level constants, and another to set
the level topology. Non-browser-opening editor buttons have words, not icons.
This addresses issue #74 partially.

The editor can only set the English level title. You can set the intended
number of players per level, but that field has no effect anywhere yet.

0.3.4
-----

2016-05-08

Right mouse button, middle mouse button, wheel up, wheel down are all available
keys to map in the hotkey dialog. There are two keys to map for zoom now.
Default value for zoom-in is wheel-up, default for zoom-out is wheel-down.

Removed the boolean options that became superfluous after allowing mouse
buttons as hotkey bindings. Set the edge scroll speed to 0 to disable it.

Pause accepts two keybindings. I'd like multiple keys for any function.

Singleplayer browser shows author and save requirement, allows to delete level.

Culled variable spawn interval UI and level variables.

Fixed wrong phymap querying: clamping coordinates on a torus must wrap them.

Fixed a crash, the game tried to dispose a null state after long play.

0.3.3
-----

2016-05-03

Fix #42: Zoom increases at level start until at least 70 % of map screen
space is filled. This makes for dynamic zoom per level, per resolution.

Fix #31: I drew air where solid after batch-framestepping, when lots of
drawing and removing happened in short succession. geoo has suggested
the new algorithm that's both simpler and bug-free. Thanks!

0.3.2
-----

2016-05-03

Editor skill window: Clicking the label "Fling-exploder" affects checkbox,
too. Buttons resized and captioned according to Proxima's suggestions.

0.3.1
-----

2016-05-01

File picker scrolls with the mouse wheel.

Replay browser can delete files and lists player names next to files.

The editor keeps the manual or automatic screen start from old levels,
even though it cannot change the screen start yet.

Fix #66: Boolean options react to mouse clicks on their label, not only
to mouse clicks on the checkbox itself.

0.3.0
-----

2016-04-27

Physics change: We don't check for physics near the eye, which would have
depended on the spritesheet. Instead we check at (foot) + (0, y), where
y is 0, -4, -8, and -12. This check is independent from the current lix job.
Rationale: http://www.lemmingsforums.net/index.php?topic=2678

0.2.49
------

2016-04-27

Level and replay browsers select adjacent directories and files by hotkey.

Tile browsers in the editor remember the last-chosen tile's directory,
and use the screen real estate better with 6 x 10 items at a time.

0.2.48
------

Fix: Singleplayer results overwrite outdated level results.

Editor rotates and mirrors terrain pieces, and toggles the dark flag.

When you enter a directory in a browser and the picker highlights the
recent file, this file is scrolled into view.

0.2.47
------

2016-04-20

Fix #65: Sign error when computing the offset for steel checks. The error
shifted steel checks too far into the ground and to the right.

Backwards framestepping is accelerated by 1/lag, where the lag is measured
as ratio (FPS / ideal number of FPS). Slight difference in memory management
for savestates, but no manual management yet.

0.2.46
------

2016-04-20

Fix regression #64: Options menu didn't offer choice of language.

Fix minor bug #62: Profiling via version statements, not empty structs that
would make a call to an allocating string-formatter.

Fixed a crash on opening non-UTF8 files in the Lix file format reader.

Editor allows to clone and z-order-rearrange tiles. There is a bug left behind
when reordering many pieces at once: Sometimes, they reorder among each other
only, producing no change after the entire reordering command.

Sound effects are loaded lazily, that boosts the program start.

0.2.45
------

2016-03-11

Editor UI allows to set the grid by mouse and hotkeys, as in C++/A4 Lix.

Editor moves tiles according to the grid. The clicked-and-dragged tile snaps
to the grid. All other selected tiles move along with it, without snapping to
grid themselves. When moving by keyboard, nothing snaps to grid. The behavior
in this paragraph is identical to C++/A4 Lix.

Editor saves on exiting to ./levels/editor-test.txt.

0.2.44
------

2016-03-30

Browsers offer breadcrumb navigation to pick directories.
We're missing some central features in these browsers now:
https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/63

Fixed imports for dmd 2.071.

0.2.43
------

2016-03-26

Editor offers the window to set skills.

The chosen ploder is loaded and offered during play. Levels remember the
chosen ploder, even if 0 ploders are available. The ploder shown on the
panel is the nuke skill.

Bug #4 (game ignores tiles that don't fit into VRAM) doesn't crash anymore,
but ignores the tile instead. The game shows the missing-image error.

0.2.42
------

2016-03-23

Editor adds pieces selected from the tile browser. Editor moves tiles by
keyboard and mouse. No snapping to grid yet.

Fixed #57: The builder gets closer to a vertical wall before stopping.
Fixed #60: The editor selects newly-added tiles immediately.
Fix: Editor-added tiles are clamped to the map, they don't spawn off-bounds.
Fix: The file listing ignores files with pre-extension X, like _order.X.txt.

Rewrote many functions everywhere to take one Point instead of 2 ints.
I have to test for performance regressions.

0.2.41
------

2016-03-18

Singleplayer browser, replay browser, and editor terrain browser all use
the new file picker.

Bugs:
*   Keyboard controls for file up/down are missing. Regression due to rewrite.
*   Scrollbar doesn't react to mouse wheel, or to clicks on the track or car.
*   Replay browser formats the button like the level browser. There is a
    child class for replay button formatting, which I am not using yet.

Misdesign: Picker should control UpOneDirButton. See comment in uponedir.d.

0.2.40
------

2016-03-13

Editor has a terrain browser that can only exit. No browsing for terrain yet.
There's a scrollbar in that terrain browser. The buttons at its end can be
clicked and move the car. The car doesn't do anything when dragged or pulled.

0.2.39
------

Fixed bug #51: Basher always left relics after his first swing.

0.2.38
------

Editor moves tiles by dragging with the mouse. No keyboard movement yet.

0.2.37
------

2016-03-06

Editor can select all tiles.

Editor can add and remove tiles to/from the existing selection.

0.2.36
------

2016-03-05

Fixed the bug described in 0.2.35: Frame-spanning goes across or not across
the torus seam, according to mouse position on the screen. I like the results
in many cases so far. Anything more would require tracking the map scrolling.

Editor has a button for frame-dragging. The button's on-ness and its hotkey
are handled in a nonstandard way, which we want.

Editor has a zoom button toggling between 1x, 2x, 4x zoom, like the game.
We should brainstorm about the zoom UI, and about default zoom.

0.2.35
------

2016-03-05

Editor frame dragging implemented. It selects the correct pieces on a torus.

Bug: It doesn't yet span the frame in the correct direction. Right now,
it always spans so that the torus seam is not included.

0.2.34
------

2016-03-03

Top edge kills unconditionally.

The editor counts and annotates hatches and exits.

0.2.33
------

2016-03-01

I run D's garbage collection whenever there are obsolete game states during
play. Profiling result: My 9-year-old laptop takes 3 ms per collection.
At 16.6 ms per frame, this slows down the back-by-1-second command.
My goal is to attack this bug: https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/38
Let's see whether anybody experiences this bug #38 still, then think again.

0.2.32
------

2016-03-01

Application starts much faster. All bitmap-loading and recoloring is lazy.
Only eye matrix generation is eagerly done at application start.

0.2.31
------

2016-02-28

Implemented editor delete button.

0.2.30
------

2016-02-27

Fix #52: Mose over a transparent terrain tile, gadget behind it:
This selects the gadget now. Before, it selected the terrain tile.

0.2.29
------

2016-02-25

Editor selects pieces on mouse click. No moving yet.

Game starts slightly faster, because I'm not searching through all internal
graphics of all resolutions. Most internal graphics are loaded lazily.
Spritesheet/player-dependent GUI elements are still eagerly loaded, so there
is opportunity for optimization here.

0.2.28
------

2016-02-24

Fix: Replays were saved with a null $BUILT instead of the level's $BUILT.

Editor mouse hovering: Solid pixels are more important than the selection box.
Holding priority invert inverts the entire sequence of terrain and gadgets.

Refactored the code, Filename and Date are immutable by default.

0.2.27
------

2016-02-21

Fix #49: Animate gadgets (most importantly, water and fire) on level start.

0.2.26
------

2016-02-21

Game saves level result on leaving play, or on loading an old state.
Autoreplays are only saved on leaving the game. Should they be saved on
reaching the end-of-game dialog already?

0.2.25
------

2016-02-20

The singleplayer browser shows checkmarks next to solved levels. However,
the game doesn't save any new checkmarks on winning yet.

0.2.24
------

2016-02-17

The editor draws white rectangles around all mouse-hovered terrain pieces.
Refactored TerPos and GadPos to be subclasses of AbstractPos, not structs.

Fix: Editor dark terrain doesn't overwrite gadgets anymore.

0.2.23
------

2016-02-16

Editor renders terrain and gadgets. It uses the same scroll starting position
as the game. I want to reintroduce the manual scroll starting position.

0.2.22
------

2016-02-15

Fixed #44: We sort dirs and levels according to the listing _order.X.txt.

0.2.21
------

2016-02-14

In singleplayer, lix start spawning 1 second after level start, not 4 seconds
after start. The nan-nan sound is played when you start the game, or whenever
you revert to the starting position.

Fixed #48: Assertion failure of climber on torus maps.
Fixed sprite positioning of the climber.

0.2.20
------

2016-02-12

The panel displays elapsed minutes and seconds since level start.

Time limits or overtime haven't been introduced yet. I'm considering to
cull singleplayer time limits from the game altogether.

0.2.19
------

2016-02-11

Fixed an assert fail for new users upon entering the singleplayer browser.

Added a command-line switch to force true fullscreen an arbitrary resolution.
This makes the game run for Ramond. If you have problems getting Lix to run,
try the following, replacing 1600x900 with your possibly different resolution:

    lix --hardfull=1600x900

0.2.18
------

2016-02-10

Sped up turbo-fast-forward: I auto-savestate only every 50 frames instead of
every 10 frames during turbo-fast-forward.

0.2.17
------

2016-02-09

Tiles are loaded differently, depending on whether they're terrain or gadgets.
Terrain tiles are loaded with an extra physics map, and a white copy of
themselves for fast dark-drawing.

I don't think this speeds up the creation of the physics mask, I'm still pretty
slow with that. This vastly speeds up the creation of the level preview image
and the VRAM level bitmap. There is profiling by RAM/VRAM and by drawing mode
of the tiles.

Fixed an assert fail in the file listings used by the browser.

Fixed #40: Misaligned image/physics for dark piece.
I want to ask Clam before I close this issue.

Culled the trampolines.

0.2.16
------

2016-02-06

Started the editor. It displays terrain and can be exited.
There is much to do still with terrain handling, dark, and no-overwrite.

0.2.15
------

2016-02-04

Slightly simplified the keyboard code. I don't believe this fixes Nepster's
stuck keys, but it might be worthwhile to ask Nepster nonetheless about it.

0.2.14
------

2016-02-03

Culled the per-level option to set a custom screen starting position.
The game centers on the average position of all hatches. This accounts
for arbitrary distributions of hatches on tori.

0.2.13
------

2016-02-02

Blocker -> walker: removed 1 frame of the anim, to mimick C++ behavior.
There is an entire unused frame now in the blocker->walker anim now.

Most things -> walker: Added a stand-still walker frame.

Floater y speed should match C++ floater.

0.2.12
------

2016-02-02

Platformer should behave as in C++ Lix now: The first brick is 8 pixels long,
all bricks while kneeling are 6 pixels long.

0.2.11
------

2016-02-01

Fixed left-facing bashers, they now ignore steel in the top 2 hi-res pixels.

Floater assignments don't cancel the builder queue anymore.

0.2.10
------

2016-01-31

Disabled the extra console on Windows by linking with -L/subsystem:windows.

Panel offers imploders.

Listing the included level's name in the replay browser when the pointed-to
level is not there. There's a bug left over for now anyway, see commit message.

0.2.9
-----

2016-01-31

Fixed 3 little bugs: Effects are correctly deleted after framestepping back.
On deleting a replay, the browser highlights the next one correctly again.
The file browser title bar shows the correct subdirectory on browser startup.

0.2.8
-----

2016-01-31

Implement #34: The game mimicks the level tree when saving replays.

0.2.7
-----

2016-01-30

Fix #35: Omitting drawing allowed bypassing traps.

The lix eye coordinate is used to determine where trigger areas affect the
lix. Before this fix, the eye coordinate was only updated on drawing the
lix, becasue the fuse should be positioned there. This allowed to bypass
traps with the head.

Also refactored over 1,000 lines of game code, for a slightly better separation
of physics model and controlling/drawing code.

2016-01-28

Fixed crash during replay verification upon nuking.

0.2.5
-----

2016-01-28

Making shutdown much faster by not freeing any RAM or VRAM.
This is standard for RAM, I have to read up on VRAM practises.

Loading way less internal data for replay verification, speeding up the
startup in that mode massively. We have to decide whether the spritesheet
should affect physics. Right now, existence of frames and eye positions
are meaningful for the physics.

0.2.4
-----

2016-01-27

Noninteractive Replay verification implemented.
Run it from the command line, as in C++ Lix:
bin/lix --verify=replays/solutions
bin/lix --verify=replays/manual/myreplay.txt

Fix: Don't save every possible replay into replays/network/.

Refactoring: Renamed PerformedActivity to Job. Made graphic objects, lixes,
and gadgets take a Topology on construction instead of a Torbit. This makes
the design much more lightweight, we don't even have to generate a Map for the
noninteractive Game.

0.2.3
-----

2016-01-26

Command-line argument `--fullscreen' forces fullscreen, no matter what the
user settings are.

The menu-OK hotkey always performs the most sensible action in the window
during a singleplayer game: resume if it's not at the end, exit if won,
restart if failed.

Editor button in the singleplayer browser, but it doesn't do anything yet.

0.2.2
-----

2016-01-25

Fix #15: Basher always left relics. The basher mask is 2 pixels wider in D
Lix. The relics check accounts for that now.

We wanted to start the basher faster by 2 frames in C++ Lix, to make it
more powerful. Right now, this is implemented in D Lix, because I used as
many recommendations by geoo as I could. In light of the mask that reaches
further by 2 pixels, we should discuss that again. The faster-starting
basher is still OK, probably.

0.2.1
-----

2016-01-25

Implemented ask-for-username menu when no name is given. This prevents having
no name set, and therefore being unable to save options.

Covered the empty space for the spawnint buttons with the info bar for now.

0.2.0
-----

2016-01-24

This is a test release, designed to try singleplayer. Don't replace your
existing installation of Lix with this D/A5 port yet. Keep it separate.

Minim has designed several scaled-up versions of the internal graphics.
They're visible whenever the game's resolution is at least 1.5 times as big
as the old 640x480. Many thanks to Minim for this work!

Levels and terrain graphics have been updated from C++ Lix.

I'm cross-compiling to Windows from Linux now. Let me know of any problems.

0.1.40
------

2016-01-23

Top-left corner of map shows the floating 'R' while replaying. The FPS are
shown on the panel right now, that's intended as a temporary solution only.

Lix target info in the panel shows (RCF) for runners/climbers/floaters, and
displays the number of bricks left for builders and platformers.

Replays cancel on LMB anywhere, and on activating the nuke.

Fix: With lixes returning equal priority, the closest one to the cursor is
preferred for an assignment. Previous bug: the farthest one was preferred.
Inverting priority doesn't invert this check, which is correct.

0.1.39
------

2016-01-22

Fix #32: With mouse speed different from 20, RMB-scrolling continued to
move even after the mouse has stopped moving, as long as RMB was kept down.

0.1.38
------

2016-01-22

The panel info bar uses the correctly recolored garden icons. They have the
correct shadow, according to the user's GUI color settings. (Even though, like
all GUI parts, they aren't recolored until the next program start.)

graphic.gralib has been refactored into a package for better readability.

0.1.37
------

2016-01-21

The replay browser can delete replays. It asks for confirmation with a message
box and moves the highlighting to the next replay.

During the game, the panel's info bar shows colored icons with numbers,
instead of the previously text-only lix counts.

0.1.36
------

2016-01-19

Faster drawing code, by holding bitmaps. Empty skills don't show their hotkey.
Fixed an assert fail on framestepping backwards across Phybit.needCol.

0.1.35
------

2016-01-18

Hatches marked as rotated in the level format spawn lemmings facing left.

0.1.34
------

2016-01-18

Replays are saved automatically on quitting a solved singleplayer level.
This still holds for exiting the game with Shift+Esc immediately.
No replay tree yet; replays are saved as manual/*.txt or solved/*.txt.

0.1.33
------

2016-01-18

Fix #12: Builders, platformers and cubers won't overwrite existing terrain.
Fix #22: Terrain removers don't draw over steel pixels.

Neither fix has affected physics. The remover visuals were particularly
urgent, because they made steel transparent, even though they didn't remove
the steel.

These fixes are implemented with iteration over the lookup map, then issuing
many copies of 1x1 rectangles to the graphics card. This is likely slower
than hardware shaders that examine the existing pixel. It's faster than
making lots of 1x1 sub-bitmaps on the heap, then destroying these again.

(Miner hits steel on my 9.5-year-old laptop: 30 ms for 1x1 sub-bitmaps, 7 ms
for 1x1 rectangles. Miner digging only through non-steel earth is much faster,
about 0.1 ms, and therefore uses the previously existing drawing code.)

The cuber sprite is transparent where it has been drawn to land already.
Now, the player can guess much better when which pixels are added.
I've added a few sparky lines to the cuber's last few frames.

I have removed the tumbler assert. See comment on issue #21:
https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/21

0.1.32
------

2016-01-17

Fix #28: Empty skills are now re-selected if replenished after state loading.
Fix #29: Drawing explosions properly now.

I haven't tested implosions. They should be drawn behind the terrain anyway,
or get a completely new animation.

0.1.31
------

2016-01-16

Basher ignores top two rows of his 18 rows for steel.

Partial fix of #22: basher/miner cancels on hitting steel, but still takes
out some of the graphics. Physics are correct.

After class Game finishes, the correct browser is loaded, either singleplayer
or replay. Browsers exit on RMB. No option to auto-save singleplayer replays
that fail the level.

0.1.30
------

2016-01-15

Replay browser implemented. Loads replays, renders the correct level in the
preview. Program main loop calls game with the correct level and replay file,
the game plays back the correct replay. After viewing the replay, the program
goes back to the singleplayer browser, not to the replay browser.

Framestepping backwards is more performant over long distances, it omits
unnecessary intermediate savestates that would be discarded anyway. More ideas:
https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/26

Slightly better text shadow positioning. Removed demo and benchmark code.

0.1.29
------

2016-01-12

Level preview renders and scales the level correctly, instead of displaying
only a colorful rectangle.

User savestating is implemented including saving/loading, but it doesn't
preserve effects, see issue #23.

Fixed bug #13: Framestepping buttons execute continuously on holding RMB.

0.1.28
------

Implemented the nuke.

Implemented replay arrows upon skill assignments, which are correctly
played back during framestepping and after restarting the level.

Explosions, flying pixels, and flying terrain remover equipment isn't in yet.

0.1.27
------

Miner implemented with geoo's anti-shock C++ code.

Flingers and trampolines are implemented.

0.1.26
------

2016-01-04

Singleplayer browser remembers the most recently played level.

Fixed bug #18: Assigning runner to a walker didn't make her run immediately.
Fixed bug #20: Assigning exploder to builder crashed the game due to
inability to return skills.

Fixed climber horizontal alignment with the wall, the alignment was set
correctly previously, but never reset correctly.

Exploder with flinging is now implemented similar to how it was in C++.
It should be checked for accuracy, once loading replays from disk is
implemented.

Fixed a crash on becoming tumbler. There is still an elusive assert fail
triggerable in the tumbler function. That should be debugged once replays
can be loaded from disk.

0.1.25
------

2016-01-03

Fixed bug #19: Tumbler selected only frames 2 or 3. Now, it selects its frame
by angle of flight now, while not advancing too far in any single frame.
https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/19

0.1.24
------

2016-01-02

Fixed bug #10: Map drawing: Target area too large.
https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/10

0.1.23
------

2016-01-01

Options menu complete. Some options don't do anything yet, but are loaded/saved
correctly nonetheless. Removed fullscreen resolution option. Switching users
works. Switching Language works.

I found the first bug of 2016 in the D compiler. ^_^

0.1.22
------

2015-12-31

Implemented GUI elements: Text entry, number picker, hotkey picker.
In the options menu, implemented 2/3 hotkey pages, and the graphics page.
Each hotkeyed button displays its hotkey in the bottom-right-hand corner.

Added 0.5f to the djvuM offset (the main font's vertical position), now
it looks great on 640x480, 800x600, 1280x1024, and 1400x1050.

0.1.21
------

2015-12-29

Implemented goals (exits), triggered traps, and dying outside of the level.
Implemented the Esc-during-level menu and the end-of-level menu. No browser
to save/view replays yet. Begun implementing the options menu.

0.1.17
------

2015-12-17

Bugfix: Blockers are now released upon walker assignment.

0.1.16
------

2015-12-16

All skills are implemented fully or mostly each, except for the miner,
which is missing completely still. Effects, like arrows, flying dig hammers,
and explosions, are missing.

Skills behave mostly identical to C++ Lix. Some extremely arcane behavioral
bugs were fixed while porting; report if things behave obviously strangely.
Probably also report if things behave differently.

Known differences: Exploder crater is 1 pixel smaller, diameter of 46 pixels
instead of 47 pixels, but should be completely symmetrical now. Blocker
doesn't get released on walker assignment; this fixed only in 0.1.17.

0.1.12
------

2015-11-30

Implemented builder and digger. The builder still draws on top of existing
land, which is merely a visual bug, not a physics bug. The digger makes
steel transparent, but the steel and terrain data inside the steel remains
present for physics; again only a visual bug.

0.1.5
-----

2015-11-19

Map detects mouse on the land properly, at least with zoom == 1. Priority
computation has been ported over. You can click lix and hear the assign
sound being played if the assignment were legal. Assignments aren't in yet.

0.1.4
-----

2015-11-15

Walker, Faller and Ascender are implemented and should perform like their
C++ versions. I would like to keep close to the C++ behavior for now.
Savestates have been implemented for framestepping. Skill assignments
are not possible yet.

0.1.2
-----

2015-10-30

Started implementing Lix skills. There will likely be no problem with them
scanning the terrain from the lookupmap. I'm anxious about them writing to
the terrain later on, when the more interesting skills get added.

0.1.0
-----

2015-08-24

First Windows build released on Lemmings Forums as a smoke test. It runs
well for most people. Drawing has bad performance still with about 3,500
animated gadgets, but is much better with about 200 than in the previous
months.

0.0.0
-----

2015-02-28

Started development by porting the fundamental Lix graphic classes from
Allegro 4.4 to Allegro 5 with the D Programming Language.
